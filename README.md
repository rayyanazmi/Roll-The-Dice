*Description: The app screen after rolling the dice, displaying a random number.*

**Explanation:**

The first screenshot shows the initial state of the app with the "Roll Dice" button. The second screenshot shows the app after the dice has been rolled, displaying a random number.

**Implementation:**

The app uses Flutter's state management and widget building concepts to create the dice rolling functionality. The dice image is updated using a setState call to trigger a rebuild of the widget with the new random number.

**Code Structure:**

The app is built using Flutter's state management to update the dice's value on each roll. The dice's appearance is handled using a combination of widgets and animations.

**Future Improvements:**

* **Multiple dice:** Add support for rolling multiple dice simultaneously.

* **Customizable dice:** Allow users to choose the number of sides on the dice.

* **Sound effects:** Add sound effects for the dice roll and the landing of the number.

* **Theming:** Implement a theming system to allow users to customize the app's appearance.
